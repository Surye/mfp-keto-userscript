<h1>FAQ:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Q: Food item shows up in red and says bad data?! What gives?!</li>
<li>A: Someone added the food item incorrectly, and put net carbs in the carbs value, and so the fiber subtracts from it, making negative carbs. Nothing I can really do about this without modifying more data than I wish to.</li>

<li>Q: I get NaN's in the Net Carb column!</li>
<li>A: It may be you didn't have all the required columns added, go to http://www.myfitnesspal.com/account/diary_settings and make sure all the columns required are there (most likely, you need to add the fiber column).</li>

<li>Q: What about sugar alcohols?</li>
<li>A: Since MFP does not recognize these as a seperate nutrition, it will simply be up to the data entry (don't include it in carbs) or the user will have to know to ignore it.</li>
</ul>
